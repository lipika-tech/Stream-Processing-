Design and Development of Electronic Stock Exchange
Stock trading broadly refers to any buying and selling of stock, but is colloquially used to refer to
more short-term investments made by very active investors. Most stocks are traded on physical or
virtual exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for example, is a physical exchange
where some trades are placed manually on a trading floor—yet, other trading activity is conducted
electronically. NASDAQ, on the other hand, is a fully electronic exchange where all trading
activity occurs over an extensive computer network, matching investors from around the world
with each other in the blink of an eye. Investors and traders submit orders to buy and sell shares,
either through a broker or by using an online platform such as an E*Trade.
A buyer bids to purchase shares at a specified price (or at the best available price) and a seller asks
to sell the stock at a specified price (or at the best available price). When a bid and an ask match,
a transaction occurs and both orders will be filled. In a very liquid market, the orders will be filled
almost instantaneously. In a thinly traded market, however, the order may not be filled quickly or
at all. On an electronic exchange, such as NASDAQ, buyers and sellers are matched electronically.
Market makers (similar in function to the specialists at the physical exchanges) provide bid and
ask prices, facilitate trading in certain security, match buy and sell orders, and use their own
inventory of shares, if necessary.
Active trading is when an investor who places 10 or more trades per month. They often use
strategies that rely heavily on timing the market. They try to take advantage of short-term events
(at the company or in the market) to turn a short-term profit. Day trading means playing hot potato
with stocks — buying and selling the same stock in a single trading day. Day traders care little
about the inner workings of the businesses. They try to make a few bucks in the next few minutes,
hours or days based on daily price swings.
